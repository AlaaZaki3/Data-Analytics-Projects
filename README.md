# Data-Analytics-Projects
This repository is mainly for Data analytics projects using Python
Those projects will help you learn to clean and organize data, uncover patterns and insights using Statistics, you will develop your programming skills using  different libraries of python, and learn you how to use jupyter notebook to build and write your project.


Subjects Covered during all projects will be as the following:

Open source:
Anaconda: Learn to use Anaconda to manage packages and environments for use with Python
Jupyter Notebook: Learn to use this open-source web application


Statistics:

Probability
Conditional Probability
Binominal Distribution
Sampling Distribution and Central Limit Theorem
Descriptive Statistics
Inferential Statistics
Confidence Levels and Intervals
Hypothesis Testing
T-tests 
Regression
Multiple Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
time series

Data Extraction

GATHERING DATA:
Gather data from multiple sources, including gathering files
Import data of various file formats into pandas, including flat files (e.g. TSV), HTML files, TXT files, and JSON files


ASSESSING DATA
Assess data visually and programmatically using pandas
Distinguish between dirty data (content or “quality” issues) and messy data (structural or “tidiness” issues)

CLEANING DATA
Identify each step of the data cleaning process (defining, coding,and testing)
Clean data using Python

Data Visualisation:

Univariate exploration of data ( histogram , bar charts , Use axis limits and different scales )
Bivariate exploration of data ( scatter plots , clustered bar charts , violin and bar charts , faceting )
Multivariate exploration of data ( encodings , plot matrices)
Explanatory Visulizations ( story telling with data)
