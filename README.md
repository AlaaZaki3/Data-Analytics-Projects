# Data-Analytics-Projects
This repository is mainly for Data analytics projects using Python. Those projects will help you clean and organize data, figure out patterns and insights using Statistics, you will develop your programming skills using different libraries of python, and learn you how to use jupyter notebook to build your project.

## You will learn throughout the projects:
### Open source: 
* Anaconda: Learn to use Anaconda to manage packages and environments for using with Python
* Jupyter Notebook: Learn to use this open-source web application

### Statistics:
* Probability Conditional 
* Probability Binominal Distribution 
* Sampling Distribution and Central Limit Theorem 
* Descriptive Statistics 
* Inferential Statistics 
* Confidence Levels and Intervals 
* Hypothesis Testing 
* A/B Test
* T-tests 
* Regression 
* Multiple Linear Regression 
* Logistic Regression 
* time series

### Data Extraction:
* GATHERING DATA: 
  * Gather data from multiple sources, including gathering files Import data of various file formats into pandas, including flat files (e.g. TSV), HTML files, TXT files, and JSON files
* ASSESSING DATA:
  * Assess data visually and programmatically using pandas Distinguish between dirty data (content or “quality” issues) and messy data (structural or “tidiness” issues)
* CLEANING DATA:
  * Identify each step of the data cleaning process (defining, coding, and testing) Clean data using Python

### Data Visualisation:
* Univariate exploration of data ( histogram, bar charts, Use axis limits and different scales ) 
* Bivariate exploration of data ( scatter plots, clustered bar charts, violin and bar charts, faceting ) 
* Multivariate exploration of data ( encodings, plot matrices)
* Explanatory Visualizations ( storytelling)
